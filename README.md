# Laboratory work: Two-dimensional arrays.

There are two different variants of tasks in this laboratory work. When you open the file, you will see the menu, where you can select the number of the task and see its description.

### Variant 2.

An integer rectangular matrix is given. 
1) Determine the number of columns that do not contain any zero elements. 
2) As a characteristic of a row of an integer matrix we call the sum of its positive even elements. Rearrange the rows of a given matrix and arrange them according to the growth of the characteristics. 
3) Determine whether the matrix is a magic square, i.e. a matrix in which sums of elements in all rows and columns are equal. 
4) By rearranging its rows and columns, achieve that the largest element (or one of them) is in the upper left corner. 

### Variant 16.

An integer rectangular matrix is given. Determine: 
1) Arrange the rows of an integer rectangular matrix by increasing the number of identical elements in each row. 
2) Find the number of the first column that does not contain any negative elements. 
3) Count how many different numbers are in the matrix. 
4) Fill the matrix with natural numbers from 1 to the spiral starting in the upper left corner and twisted clockwise.
